The way that I am making<br> this character is by 3d modelling it in blender as well as rigging<br> and animating it there as well<br>Vento is an Artificer (Magical Engineer) who specialises on making<br> magical firearms and cannons. He is from the fictional  <br>country of the menagirie coast and is from the tinkerer town of Port Zoon.<br> Vento is an Air Genasi which means he has some essence of the elemental plane<br> of Air in him. This gives him certain abilites such as producing<br> air inside of his lungs and having minor control over air and lightning. <br> eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.<br> Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco <br>laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

    <p class="header">Design Implications</p>
         
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p class="maintext">Aesthetic considerations are the way that  
             my character looks <br> visually overall. This is important because I addressed my<br> character’s aesthetics by making them distinctive by keeping<br> to a theme. This theming should be around the color blue and have an<br> air theme. This theming should make my character stand<br> out more and become more recognisable. <br>
             <br>
             Functionality ensures that the character works properly <br> within the game. This is important because my character <br> working is one of the most important aspects of this <br> project.I addressed the functionality of my character by <br>
             taking into account of aniamtions that my character will <br> 
             need to be able to do. These consist of running animations, <br> jumping animations, gun pullout animations as well as <br> Firing animations. 
             <br>
             <br>
             Usability affects how easily players can understand and <br> interact with my character. This is important because to<br> make a game that people want to play it has to be usable <br> Players can easily use and understand my character because <br> I am taking into consideration simplifing aspects of <br> the character to make the important aspects of the <br> stand out more. This will direct Players attention to the <br> most important design parts of the character. I will also <br> make sure that the controls for my character are intuative <br>
             <br>
             Intellectual property protects original ideas from being <br> copied. It’s important because as I do not want my work and <br> character being used for things that I do not want them <br> to be used for. 
             To ensure my character is original, I must make <br> my character distinctive and recognisable so that it is obvious that they<br> are my character and not someone elses.

        <p class="subheadercenter">Turnaround</p>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            
            <p class="maintext">I drew a character turnaround for my character. This was a quick sketch <br>mostly to judge proportions for my 3d model. By using the 8 heads template I<br>can get the proportions to make my character look lanky and tall. <br> To complete this step, first I got reference images, then Imagined in my head<br>what this character should look like. After this I drew the sketch using <br> proportions 
            <br> I have made decisions such as making him tall, as I think this fits his character<br>as he is a steampunk/fantasy engineer who is highly skilled with firearms. This <br> would mean that he would not have much time to train with other weapons. <br>Some other key design elements were the gas mask and goggles. This is to <br>add to the steampunk aesthetic and tell a story about the character. His skin <br> is light blue (Although not seeable from the turnaround) because he is an air<br>genasi (a Person with wind elemental energy in them). Keeping with this <br>theme I have made his robes a darker blue to fit into this color theme.

        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p class="maintext">"I tested the design by putting it as a PDF into Blender. <br>This yeilded mixed results as there were issues with the allignment. <br>The drawings as well were subpar and did not capture the concept I was trying to recreate<br>An additional way I tested this turnaround, is that I asked<br>for feedback from my peers. They echoed my thoughts<br> about the issue with the allignement and suggested that I used mechanisms such as a <br> function on one of the printers to upload my image directly <br> from the paper copy to my drive, this meant that I did not have to concern<br>Myself with Photo allignement.<br> Positive feedback I got from my peers, is that<br>they liked the concept and thoguht the drawing, while not perfect was alright<br> </p>

        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p class="maintext">Based on the testing and feedback, I decided that my main issue was allignement<br>So I sought out to fix that. To do that, I used the upload function the printer to accuratly<br> upload my image to the computer without having any issues<br> The Reason that alligment was vital was that it meant that if it was not  <br> alligned, it would mean that I was moddellign side view and front view at different heights.<br>This would certainly made my model innacurate and bad<br>My Turnaround is now more effective due to these changes<br>as it is exactly alligned which means I do not need to free model<br>Rather I can go off of my turnaround<br> </p>

                </div>  
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p class="maintext">I modelled the base of my character. <br>This model contained the body, head, arms and legs of the model.  <br>I used my previous reference to get a basic shape of the<br> body, and then continued to model it in more detail <br> for the head,  I have made the head scale in with the rest of the relatively slim body; this is a  <br>key part of my character, and makes it recognisable. I have also carefully <br> made places for other components of the characters head, redially avaliable <br>to be used 
            <br>For the body, I have made this character purposefully quite slim as that is his general<br> build. I mirrored this approach in the arms and legs making him proportionate to the rest of the body<br>I have tried to fit the vibe of a steampunk engineer into this model and have thought about<br>what who he is makes him look like.<br>This thinking has guided my design and modelling process<br> </p>

        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p class="maintext">I  tested my design by comparing it to my reference
            <br>and it turned out relatively similar to what I imagined for the reference. 
            <br>I also as earlier asked my peers for feedback. While they liked the general<br> model, they thought that there were improvements to be made to the head.  <br> Some positive feedback that came from my peers was that they liked the level<br> of detail on the rest of the body<br></p>

        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p class="maintext">Based on my testing and feedback, I decided that the head was the biggest issue. <br> So got to work and I got rid of the bump and weird angle<br> on top of the head,as well as making the face less wide for more realism 
            <br>I made these adjustments to make the head more realistic <br> and natural rather than the alien face shape I had before<br>The changes additionally conformed to my character more.<br> I think this is a better representation of my idea for this character<br> as it is more natural and human. This makes the model stronger and meets my<br> specifications and requirements more accuratly.<br> </p>

        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p class="maintext">I animated my model. By using the animation function in Blender.<br>To animate the model, first I had to rig it. <br>Rigging is a process which requires putting an armature <br>Which is kind of like a skeleton for the model. In inside<br>the model and having them connected through a process called parenting. <br>After I did this I was free to animate my model.<br>My first project for this was to get an idle animation.<br>For this I made the model bop up and down.<br></p>

        </div>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p class="maintext">I tested my animation by running it and seeing how it worked. <br>It was functional, however I felt that the movements were over exagerated. <br>When I asked some of my peers about the animation, they suggested adding in arm movements<br> and body movements that were not only vertical<br> such as the character leaning over slightly to make it seem more natural<br></p>
