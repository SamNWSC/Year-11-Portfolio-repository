<p class="maintext">This website is a project for year 11. Throughout the year I will be collecting all of my projects <br>
in one place to act as a 'Digital CV'. This year I will put 3 different projects on this website and

<br>show the skills I used to make them so I have all of my projects for this year in one place to 
<br>
show a potential employer or university. These projects will use a wide variey of tools and 
<br>
languages to make these projects. This also will tell anyone who is interested: Who I am, <br>
What skills I have, what my hobbies are, how to contact me, and the design process for my projects.
